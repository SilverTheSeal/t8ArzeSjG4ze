| Question 1 |

Hello my love, last Christmas you gave me an Enigmagram letter. It took me two hours to solve it. Then in the next couple days, you gave me another one online. This time it's your turn to solve a puzzle, but I wanted to make it special for you. I have modified an old game I made to give you a daisy chain of puzzles for you to work through, at the end of it is your birthday present. To get to it, all you need to do is answer the 6 different puzzles I've set up for you and input the answers into the box above. However, unlike the Enigmagram, you will be using my computer and Google to solve them, but that doesn't mean it will be easy. To begin, the password is the band name of the song I've parodied in the first couple of sentences, I hope you enjoy what I've made for you, good luck!
